The FunFactBot is a Discord bot I taught myself how to make overnight for a server I am in. Why? Because I thought it would be funny—it was—and I wanted to learn someething new. 

The FunFactBot will reply to user that pings it with a random response that is pulled from an array of responses. 
The FunFactBot also has a `/fun-fact` command the will offer a random fact about Computer programming, philosophy, or beer.
